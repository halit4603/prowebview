# ProWebView
ProWebView is another WebView for Android with more functionality and without the hell of the WebViewClient and the WebChromeClient. With ProWebView you don't have to worry about asking permissions, file download, file upload, JS alerts and dialogs, links without protocols, cache managing and/or cookies managing.

## Installation
First of all you need to add the jitpack.io repo to your top-level gradle file:
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
	...
	maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```

And add this dependence to the app-level gradle:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.vic797:prowebview:VERSION'
}
```

## Usage
Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/vic797/prowebview/wiki) to know how to use it.

## Contribute
ProWebView has a lot of features and not all of that features have been tested exhaustively; please report any bug you find. Thanks!

If you want to help with translations pull a request with a modified [strings.xml](https://github.com/vic797/prowebview/blob/master/library/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) and I will add the translation to the library.
